# Practice-Problem1
Given a string input, return the same string, but with all vowels scrambled randomly in each word. From Justis.
Things I would change are: 
  adding in a check that that vowels are not being returned randomly scrambled back into their original positions, and then running the array back through the    shuffle function until they are returned in different positions
  Simplifying? Seems like the 2nd forEach loop that loops through each words' letters to check if vowels and replace positions could have been simplified in some way.
